# Explanation of the Wave Equation Solver

This notebook cell implements a **least-squares solution** of the **1D wave equation** on a spaceâ€“time grid.

---

## 1. The PDE

We want to solve the **1D wave equation**:

$$
u_{tt} - u_{xx} = 0, \quad (t,x) \in [0,T]\times[-L,L]
$$

with conditions:

- **Initial condition (at \(t=0\)):**
$$
u(0,x) = \exp\!\Big(-\frac{x^2}{\sigma^2}\Big)
$$

- **Boundary conditions (at \(x=-L,\,x=L\)):**
$$
u(t, -L) = u(t, L) = 0
$$

- **Terminal condition (at \(t=T\)):**
$$
u(T, x) = 0
$$

---

## 2. Discretization

We discretize the domain with:
- \(nx\) spatial points, spacing
$$
dx = \frac{2L}{nx-1}
$$
- \(nt\) time points, spacing
$$
dt = \frac{T}{nt}
$$

The centered finite-difference approximation of the wave operator is:

$$
\frac{u_{i+1,j} - 2u_{i,j} + u_{i-1,j}}{dt^2}
-
\frac{u_{i,j+1} - 2u_{i,j} + u_{i,j-1}}{dx^2} = 0
$$

which, after rearrangement, gives coefficients:

$$
c_1 = \frac{1}{2 dt^2}, \quad
c_0 = -\frac{1}{2 dx^2}, \quad
c_2 = -\frac{dx^2 - dt^2}{dt^2 dx^2}.
$$

Thus, each interior equation couples five unknowns:

$$
c_1 u_{i-1,j} + c_0 u_{i,j-1} + c_2 u_{i,j} + c_0 u_{i,j+1} + c_1 u_{i+1,j} = 0
$$

## 3. Sparse matrix construction

The code builds two sparse matrices, `dF` and `dG`, to represent the discrete operators for the PDE and the associated conditions.

- **`dF` (PDE operator):** Encodes the 5-point stencil for the wave equation at all **interior** grid points.

- **`dG` (Conditions operator):** Enforces all other conditions by creating identity rows that select the corresponding `u` values:
  - **Initial condition ($t=0$):** enforces $u(0,x_j) = \exp(-x_j^2/\sigma^2)$.
  - **Boundary conditions ($x=\pm L$):** enforces $u(t, \pm L) = 0$.
  - **Terminal condition ($t=T$):** enforces $u(T, x_j) = 0$.

Both matrices are stored in the efficient **CSR (Compressed Sparse Row)** format.

---

## 4. Least-squares formulation

Following the ODIL (Operator Discretization and Inference Library) framework, we formulate the problem as minimizing a loss function $L(u)$, which is the sum of squared residuals:

$$
L(u) = \|F[u]\|_2^2 + \|G[u]\|_2^2
$$

Here, $F[u]$ and $G[u]$ are discrete operators representing the residuals of the PDE and the associated conditions. For this linear problem, they take the form:

- $F[u] = dF \cdot u - f$: The residual of the wave equation at interior points. `dF` is the sparse matrix for the PDE, and the right-hand-side vector `f` is zero.
- $G[u] = dG \cdot u - g$: The residual for the initial, boundary, and terminal conditions. `dG` selects grid points on the domain boundary, and `g` contains the target values for these conditions.

The vector $u$ represents the solution at all grid points, flattened into a single vector. We seek the $u$ that minimizes $L(u)$. This is a linear least-squares problem, and its solution is found by solving the **normal equations**:

$$
(dF^T dF + dG^T dG) u = dF^T f + dG^T g
$$

The code implements a Newton-Raphson iterative solver. For a general (non-linear) problem, the update step is:

$$
M (u_{new} - u_{old}) = - (dF^T F_s + dG^T G_s)
$$

where:
- $M = dF^T dF + dG^T dG$ is the Hessian matrix.
- $F_s = dF \cdot u_{old} - f$ is the PDE residual at the current iteration (`Fs` in the code).
- $G_s = dG \cdot u_{old} - g$ is the conditions residual at the current iteration (`Gs` in the code).

The right-hand side of the update is the negative gradient of the loss function. Since our problem is linear, the solver converges to the exact solution in a single step (if starting from $u_{old}=0$).
